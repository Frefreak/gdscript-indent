# gdscript-indent

The default indenting behavior for gdscript is a bit annoying. Since
the syntax of `gdscript` is very similar to `python` I found just using
the indent file of python works out great. So for now this repo would
just uses the indent file for `python` until I tweak it in the future into
a real indent file for gdscript (possibly when I find some cases that needs to
be dealt with).
